# Skeleton Smasher

## Purpose of Skeleton Smasher
Clicker games or incremental games are a genre of game in which the player accumulates an increasing amount of score (initially recieved only by an action such as clicking a button with your mouse cursor). The player then uses that score to buy objects which automate the accumulation of score for the player (although some games in this genre incentivise the player to continue clicking). These objects usually come in different categories and the more expensive they are the more quickly they accumulate score for the player. Each consecutive purchase from a single category of objects becomes increasingly expensive as the player buys more of them. In the clicker game genre, the player is rewarded quickly in the beginning with small rewards but the length of time between purchases of objects increases as the playtime increases with the player's satisfaction usually coming from buying increasingly expensive and efficient objects to automate the process. 

Because the objects the player buys can automate the process in clicker games, the player can leave their game to play for itself, meaning that as a clicker game's playtime goes on, often the player will only return to buy objects before returning to do something else away from the game.

Although seemingly pointless, clicker games are enjoyable because they reward the player with the satisfaction of achieving something when they buy an object even though they have not necessarily done anything complex or requiring attention.

The Skeleton Smasher website is a website that allows the user to play a simple clicker game for their own enjoyment. The user comes to the landing page where they are told the fictional story behind the game and given the instructions to play the game.

 The user is directed to the actual game page and has to click the button and eventually buy units of increasing expense and quality and upgrades for their clicking. The game tracks their score, total score among other statistics and the ver increasing numbers provide a sense of satisfaction to the user even if they are not actually doing anything strenous or challenging.
