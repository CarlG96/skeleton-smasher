# Skeleton Smasher

## Purpose of Skeleton Smasher
Clicker games or incremental games are a genre of game in which the player accumulates an increasing amount of score (initially recieved only by an action such as clicking a button with your mouse cursor). The player then uses that score to buy objects which automate the accumulation of score for the player (although some games in this genre incentivise the player to continue clicking). These objects usually come in different categories and the more expensive they are the more quickly they accumulate score for the player. Each consecutive purchase from a single category of objects becomes increasingly expensive as the player buys more of them. In the clicker game genre, the player is rewarded quickly in the beginning with small rewards but the length of time between purchases of objects increases as the playtime increases with the player's satisfaction usually coming from buying increasingly expensive and efficient objects to automate the process. 

Because the objects the player buys can automate the process in clicker games, the player can leave their game to play for itself, meaning that as a clicker game's playtime goes on, often the player will only return to buy objects before returning to do something else away from the game.

Although seemingly pointless, clicker games are enjoyable because they reward the player with the satisfaction of achieving something when they buy an object even though they have not necessarily done anything complex or requiring attention.

The Skeleton Smasher website is a website that allows the user to play a simple clicker game for their own enjoyment. The user comes to the landing page where they are told the fictional story behind the game and given the instructions to play the game.

The user is directed to the actual game page and has to click the button and eventually buy units of increasing expense and quality and upgrades for their clicking. The game tracks their score, total score among other statistics and the ver increasing numbers provide a sense of satisfaction to the user even if they are not actually doing anything strenous or challenging.

## Features
## Future Features
## Typography and Color Scheme
## Wireframes and Prototypes
## Technology Used
* HTML
    * Used to build the structure of the website and for audio and some of the image elements.

* CSS 
    * Used to style the website and change the website depending on screen sizes with media queries. Also used to add background images to the unit/ upgrade buttons.

* Balsamiq Wireframes
    * Used for prototyping and making a rough outline of the main game webpage (the intro was not sufficiently complex enough to warrant a wireframe).

* Font Awesome
    * Scripts and Icons were used to 
## Testing
* HTML Validator
    * When passed through the W3C HTML validator no errors were found on index.html or skeleton-smasher.html files. There were warnings about not using headings for some sections however I have chosen to ignore these warnings as they would negatively affect the look of the website and would only clutter the screenspace on smaller device sizes.
* CSS Validator
    * When passed through the W3C CSS validator no errors were found.
* Search Engines
    * The Skeleton Smasher Intro and Skeleton Smasher webpages are fully functional and work in the Google Chrome web browser.
    * The Skeleton Smasher Intro and Skeleton Smasher webpages are fully functional and work in the Brave web browser.
    * The Skeleton Smasher Intro and Skeleton Smasher webpages are fully functional and work in the Firefox web browser.

* Screen Sizes
    * The Skeleton Smasher Intro and Skeleton Smasher webpages are fully functional across a wide range of devices in DevTools with no obvious visual glitches.

* Text Contrast
    * The dark background of dark grey and black contrast well with the gold colored and white text to allow it to be easily read and made legible.

* Functionality
    * I confirmed that the external links between the two webpages are functional.
    * I confirmed that the buttons for adding score/ total score and buying units and upgrades are functional; the buttons produce the desired output on the right hand side of the screen in regards to numbers.
    * I confirmed that the automatic incremental functions for score, total score and Skeletons Smashed per second work as intended and display the correct values.
    * I confirmed that there are limits to the amount of score, total score, units and upgrades such that the numbers never rise to high to cause visual glitching on the webpage across a wide range of devices.

* Lighthouse Check
    * I confirmed that the Skeleton Smasher Intro and Skeleton Smasher webpages passed the Lighthouse Check in DevTools across both mobile and desktop environments.
